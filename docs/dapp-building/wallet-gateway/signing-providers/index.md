# Signing Providers

The Wallet Gateway supports multiple signing providers that handle cryptographic key management and transaction signing. Each provider has different use cases and security characteristics.

## Available Providers

## Wallet Gateway (Internal)

The Wallet Gateway provider stores private keys directly in the signing store database. This is suitable for development and testing but **not recommended for production** use cases where security is critical.

**Configuration:**

This provider is automatically available when a `signingStore` is configured in the Gateway configuration. No additional setup is required.

**Use Cases:**

- Local development
- Testing environments
- Proof-of-concept applications

**Security Considerations:**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Private keys are stored in the database. If the database is compromised, all keys are at risk. Use only in non-production environments.

## Participant-Based Signing

The Participant signing provider uses Canton's participant node for signing transactions. The participant maintains the key material and handles all cryptographic operations.

**Configuration:**

This provider is always available and requires no additional configuration. You simply select it when creating a party.

**Use Cases:**

- Enterprise deployments where the participant node manages keys
- Scenarios where key management is handled by the infrastructure
- Operator-controlled deployments where wallet creation is not exposed via the User API

**Security Considerations:**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Participant-based signing is **not recommended** in production setups where the User API is accessible. Any user who can reach the User API can create parties that sign via your participant node, which may grant broader signing authority than intended. Reserve participant-based signing for deployments where wallet creation is restricted to trusted operators, or use an external signing provider (Fireblocks, Dfns, Blockdaemon) when the User API is exposed in production.

**How it Works:**

When a transaction is submitted, the Gateway forwards the command to the participant node, which signs it using the party's key stored in the participant's keystore.

## Fireblocks

Fireblocks is a third-party crypto custody service provider that offers enterprise-grade key management and signing services.

**Setup:**

1. Complete steps 1-3 from the [Fireblocks signing documentation](https://github.com/canton-network/wallet/tree/main/core/signing-fireblocks)

2. Supply an environment variable named `FIREBLOCKS_API_KEY` containing your Fireblocks API key (from the `API User (ID)` column in the Fireblocks API users table).

**Configuration:**

The Fireblocks provider reads configuration from environment variables and key files. No additional Gateway configuration is needed beyond placing the required files.

**Use Cases:**

- Enterprise deployments requiring HSM-backed key storage
- Compliance-sensitive applications
- High-security production environments

## Blockdaemon

Blockdaemon provides signing services as part of their infrastructure offerings.

**Configuration:**

Set the following environment variables:

- `BLOCKDAEMON_API_URL` - The base URL for the Blockdaemon API
- `BLOCKDAEMON_API_KEY` - Your Blockdaemon API key

**Use Cases:**

- Managed infrastructure deployments
- Cloud-native applications
- Environments leveraging Blockdaemon's services

## Dfns

Dfns is a crypto custody platform that provides programmable key management and signing infrastructure.

**Configuration:**

Set the following environment variables:

- `DFNS_ORG_ID` - Your Dfns organization ID
- `DFNS_BASE_URL` - The Dfns API URL (defaults to `https://api.dfns.io`)
- `DFNS_CRED_ID` - Your service account credential ID
- `DFNS_PRIVATE_KEY` - Your service account private key (PEM format)
- `DFNS_AUTH_TOKEN` - Your service account authentication token

**Prerequisites:**

1. Set up a service account with appropriate permissions in Dfns
2. Generate and download the service account credentials

**Use Cases:**

- Enterprise deployments requiring MPC-based key management
- Programmable custody with policy controls
- Multi-party approval workflows
- High-security production environments

**How it Works:**

Dfns creates and activates Canton wallets directly through its validator integration. When the Gateway requests a wallet, Dfns provisions a Canton-formatted key, registers the party on the network, and returns the wallet ready for use. When signing a prepared transaction, Dfns broadcasts it to Canton in a single step and returns the resulting update ID. Only `Canton` and `CantonTestnet` network wallets are supported.

## Selecting a Provider

When creating a new party through the User API or web UI, you can select which signing provider to use. The choice depends on your security requirements, infrastructure setup, and compliance needs.

**Recommendations:**

- **Development/Testing**: Use Wallet Gateway (internal) or Participant-based signing
- **Production (User API accessible)**: Use Fireblocks, Dfns, or Blockdaemon
- **Production (operator-controlled, User API restricted)**: Participant-based signing may be appropriate when wallet creation is limited to trusted operators

The signing provider is selected per-party, so you can have different parties using different providers within the same Gateway instance.

## Key Management

Each provider handles key management differently:

- **Wallet Gateway**: Keys are stored in the signing store database
- **Participant**: Keys are managed by the Canton participant node
- **Fireblocks**: Keys are stored in Fireblocks' secure infrastructure (HSM-backed)
- **Blockdaemon**: Keys are managed by Blockdaemon's infrastructure
- **Dfns**: Keys are managed by Dfns' secure infrastructure

When migrating between providers, keys cannot be directly transferred. You'll need to:

1. Create a new party with the new provider
2. Transfer any assets/contracts to the new party
3. Update your dApp to use the new party
